OVERVIEW

OpenSTV is a program for implementing the single transferable vote (STV).
STV is used for electing a group of people (e.g. council, committee,
legislature) and it provides for proportional representation of the
electorate.  The idea behind proportional representation is that the
demographics of the elected group should, at least roughly, match the
demographics of the electorate.  The beauty of STV is that there are
no reserved seats and the proportional representation arises
naturally.  For more information see

In an STV election, each voter simply ranks the candidates in order of
preference.  The rules for counting the votes with STV are more
complicated than winner-take-all elections.  The votes can be counted
by hand, but it is useful to have a computer program to speed up the
process.  There are several variations of STV, but most users should
use the default options.
