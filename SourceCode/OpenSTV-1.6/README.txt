OVERVIEW

OpenSTV is a program for implementing the single transferable vote (STV).
STV is used for electing a group of people (e.g. council, committee,
legislature) and it provides for proportional representation of the
electorate.  The idea behind proportional representation is that the
demographics of the elected group should, at least roughly, match the
demographics of the electorate.  The beauty of STV is that there are
no reserved seats and the proportional representation arises
naturally.  For more information see

In an STV election, each voter simply ranks the candidates in order of
preference.  The rules for counting the votes with STV are more
complicated than winner-take-all elections.  The votes can be counted
by hand, but it is useful to have a computer program to speed up the
process.  There are several variations of STV, but most users should
use the default options.

ABOUT THE SOFTWARE AND ITS REDISTRIBUTION
OpenSTV was made paid software under the GPL in 2011, and was soon
transitioned into closed source software shortly after, ridding the
world of it's best FOSS STV software. No other software has stepped
up to the task of OpenSTV as yet, and thus I am redistributing the
old 1.6.2 version, the last no-cost GPL version. It it perfectly
legal for me to do so under the terms of the GPL as long as I link
or otherwise distribute the source. However, the issue of the
OpenSTV trademark remains, however, I believe that Jeff O'Neill
has not trademarked the OpenSTV logo or name, and thus, it should
be fine to use it as it is a verbatim copy of the old source.
