OpenSTV 1.6
- Provide YAML report for integration with DemoChoice
- Added support for equal rankings and skipped rankings on ballots
- Added support for ballot IDs
- Restructuring of data structures for ballots
- Reports are now done as plugins
- Improvements to report generation including writing to file instead of memory
- Counting methods are much faster with a large number of candidates
- Check folder Plugins for external plugins
- Reorganized package structure so that all imports use absolute paths
- OpenSTV uses threads for counting and loading ballots so user doesn't see 
  a frozen screen
- Allow manual tie-breaking in OpenSTV

OpenSTV 1.5
- Improved format of election results
- No limit on the number of candidates (previously was limited to 255
candidates)
- Election methods are now done as plugins so users can add their own
methods (although only for advanced users at this point).
- Cambridge STV can save the winner's ballots in files for determining
replacements after a vacancy
- Added statutes of some rules to the documentation
- Added draft of New Zealand Meek (work in progress)
- Added new method called QPQ
- Comments now allowed in ballot files
- Changes under the hood that make OpenSTV easier to maintain.

OpenSTV 1.4
- Fixed bug that broke Election Options dialog on mac
- Fixed bug when navigating from empty ballot
- Fixed bug in remembering working directory on mac

OpenSTV 1.3
- Rewrote OpenSTV user interface:
(1) User can only run an election from a saved ballot file
(previously, you could use a ballot file in memory).
(2) User can edit/create ballots in a separate Ballot File Editor
window and save them to a file.
- Can save election results in HTML.
- More explanatory output for Condorcet elections.
- Added subclasses for different ballot types to make it easier to
support new types.
- Changes under the hood that make OpenSTV easier to maintain.

OpenSTV 1.2
- Changed output to be more descriptive and easier to read.
- Changed implementation of SuppVote to use all rankings.
- Changed implementation of IRV to stop sooner (won't change outcome).
- Small change in reporting of the threshold for ERS97 (won't change outcome).
- Print substages for ERS97.
- Now possible to have unlimited precision (but max is set to 20 for gui).
- Meek/Warren implemented in fixed point.

OpenSTV 1.1
- Added Scottish STV rules.
- Added GPCA2000 rules.
- Added approval voting.
- Bug fixes in N. Ireland STV.
- Simplified IRV.  Now always eliminates candidates one by one and
stops when candidate has a majority (instead of stopping when 2
candidates remain).
- Show help files within OpenSTV instead of external browser because
the external browser was not working with some platforms.
- BCSTV, FTSTV, and Borda now implemented in fixed point instead of
floating point.  Coombs, Meek, and Warren still in floating point.
- Major code rewrite in STV.py.

OpenSTV 1.0
- Changed name to OpenSTV!
- Test code now in a separate file and added more tests.
- Although the tree-packed ballots greatly increased speed, they also
greatly increased memory consumption.  The tree-data structure is now
created dynamically as necessary rather than built completely.  This
retains (and sometimes improves) the speed, and memory consumption is
negligable.  Condorcet no longer uses trees.
- Ballot data now based on bytes instead of ints which uses 1/4th less
memory.  The number of candidates is now limited to 255.
- Modifications to allow the use of psyco to speed up the code.  Psyco
on average speeds up the code by a factor of 2-4 times.
- Now properly raises and catches warnings and exceptions.
- Fixed bug in Condorcet completion methods.
- Changed code structure so that each method is a class rather than a 
function.  This allows for cleaner code and better code reuse.
- Fixed bugs with withdrawn candidates.  Withdrawn candidates are now
excised from a copy of the ballots before the start of the election.  
Since it is done with a copy, it can later be undone.
- "raw" ballot format renamed as "text" format because raw also means
unpacked ballots.

pSTV 0.9
Implemented the supplemental vote and N. Ireland STV.  Started Dail
STV.  Can shuffle the ballots (interesting for Cambridge STV and
random transfer STV).  Simplified the rounding of floats to make the
code cleaner.  Implemented tree-packed ballots.  Used tree-packed
ballots with Meek, Warren, and Condorcet, greatly speeding up the
implementations of these methods.  Faster implementation of Bucklin
and Coombs.  For the curious, here are the timing statistics, in
seconds, as they have changed over time on a test of data from eight
real elections:
     SNTV:         0.6
     IRV:          7.1 ->  1.2
     BCSTV:        4.6
     Coombs:      68.6 -> 40.4 -> 24.8
     Cambridge:    3.7 ->  2.0
     ERS97:        6.4 ->  5.5
     Meek:        48.3 -> 38.7 ->  5.9
     Warren:      38.0 -> 30.7 ->  3.0
     Bucklin:      9.4 ->  3.6
     Borda:        2.3
     Condorcet:  106.0 -> 13.3 ->  7.7


pSTV 0.8
Added tabbed windows for comparing multiple election results.  The
font size can be changed for each tab separately.  The display
precision is now chosen in the Election menu and can only be changed
by rerunning the election.  The ERS97 implementation is finally in
fixed point and the desired precision can be specified (for future
implementation of ERS97-like rules such as Malta STV).  Can now
eliminate candidates before running an election.  Previously, when
loading a BLT file, eliminated candidates were removed from the
ballots.  Now, the eliminated candidates are noted but they remain on
the ballots.  This works better with allowing the user to selectively
eliminate candidates, and the user can override the eliminated
candidates specified in the BLT file.  Added more comments and did
some random code cleanups.

pSTV 0.7
Renamed Simple STV as British Columbia STV.  Fixed several UI bugs for
Mac.  Made comparisons of floating point numbers safer.  Added timing
to tests.  Made IRV much faster.  IRV eliminates all losers
simultaneously.  Fixed bug in Bucklin.  Fixed bug in Coombs.  Changed
internal ballot format: got rid of Blist and append ballots
immediately.  Revamped ballot entry to make it easier to use.  Show
brief description of method after it is selected.  Added symmetric
completion of ballots option for Borda.

pSTV 0.6
Condorcet completion methods include Borda, IRV, and SSD.  Changed
Methods menu to have an option to show only STV methods. Added
Bucklin.

pSTV 0.5.2
Added Condorcet SSD.

pSTV 0.5.1
The primary reason for this release is to change DAT files to BLT
files.  I've also added Borda count and Coombs methods.

pSTV 0.5
Now uses innosetup to create a windows installer.  Also has options to
create desktop/quicklaunch icons and associate dat files with pSTV
(with an icon).  Reverted back to previous ERS CSV format (Brian
abandoned V6).  sql output conforms to spec.  DAT files now loaded
faster than before.  When reading DAT files will handle multiple
rankings of a candidate.  Should now work properly even with very few
candidates or voters.  Will return with fewer winners than asked for
if not enough candidates receive more than 0 votes.  pSTV *should*
never crash.

pSTV 0.4.2
Can now append DAT files.  Now continues gracefully when loading a
ballot file with a bad format.  Raw ballot files can now accept a
weight.  Added an edit menu with a copy command.  Updated ERSCSV
files to V6 and can now use this format for any method (previously
it could only be used for ERS97 rules).  Changed -m ers to produce
a table to be used with SQL and to work with methods other than
ERS97 STV.  These last two changes do not conform precisely to specs
and will need to be tweaked.

pSTV 0.4.1
Added substage tiebreaking for ERS97 rules.

pSTV 0.4
Previous implementation of Meek STV was actually Warren STV.  Now Meek
is correctly implemented and Warren has been added.  Added an icon.
Clarified file formats in saving and loading ballots.  Changed how
output is handled (though invisible to user): STV.py now prints to
stdout and pSTV.py captures this stream.  Can now save output in ERS
style result sheet.

pSTV 0.3
Formal release with Cambridge rules.
Fixed little bugs in reading dat files.

pSTV 0.2.5
Removed spurious tie break messages when choosing winners for ERS97.

pSTV 0.2.4
Added exclusion of candidates in reading dat files.

pSTV 0.2.3
Fixed little bugs in reading dat files.

pSTV 0.2.2
Implemented Cambridge, MA rules.  Results are identical to CC2003,
SC2003, CC2001, SC2001, and CC1999 elections.  Fixed nasty floating
point bug that caused an error with ERS97 tests performed by Brian
Wichmann.  Comparison (>=) wasn't accurate because of difference at
around 1e-14.

pSTV 0.2.1
Several bug fixes for bugs found by Brian Wichmann when verifying
ERS97 implementation.

pSTV 0.2
Many, many changes from the previous version.  Highlights: fixed bug
in tiebreaking, ERS97 fully implemented and tested, dynamic and
fractional thresholds for RT and FT STV, all menu items now work,
thorough testing, added Simple STV rules.

pSTV 0.1
Initial Release.  Methods implemented are SNTV, IRV, Random Transfer
STV, Fractional Transfer STV, and Meek STV.  Allows for different
thresholds and delayed transfer of surplus.  Ballots can be loaded
from a file or entered via the program.  The interface needs work and
some features, such as printing, are not implemented.  Probably many,
many bugs that need to be found and fixed.
